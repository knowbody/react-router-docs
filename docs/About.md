### What React Router is

React Router helps you organise your applications based on (nested) URLs.

This offers many advantages:

 - Explicit views declarations: instantly understand what are your app views
 - Restore any view + state with a simple URL (deep-linking)
 - Nested views: react-router handle nested views and their progressive resolution
 - History: User can navigate backward/forward and restore state
 - Views transitions: automatic CSS transitions when navigating
 - Standardized app structure and behaviour, useful when working in a team

By organising your code in such a standard way, it helps you keep a sane codebase, where your views are truly independant from the context.

You can find a few useful react-router [example apps](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/tree/master/examples) on the official react-router repo.

### What React Router isn't

React router doesnt handle data-fetching, you have to use [async-props](https://github.com/ryanflorence/async-props) or other classical React data fetching mechanism.
