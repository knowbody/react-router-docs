React Router Docs

[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-2-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors)

===

**Note: This is work in progress. Please use the [main docs](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/tree/master/docs) as this ones can contain mistakes. At some point once we feel that these docs are good I'd like them to be merged to the main repo. Feel free to contribute, point out mistakes and things which the docs are lacking.**

*As there is quite a few talks about the docs not being very accesible this is my attempt to improve them. I will reuse some of the docs from the [main repo](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/tree/master/docs) and also add the missing parts here.*

### Need help with React Router

To get help with React Router I highly recommend using [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/react-router/) or [Reactiflux](http://www.reactiflux.com/), these are the places where React Router community hangs out and where you get help quickly.

**BUT...**

This is my personal repo and I want to try out something *experimental*.

As one of the maintainers I get quite a few emails, private messages on Twitter, Discord, etc. I don't mind them and I always try to help whenever I have some free time.

So I want you to use this repo instead and I will try to help here.

#### How

I added the `playground` folder where you can play around with the React Router. And if you need help use it as a boilerplate to replicate your issue and send the PR.
**Make sure that the PR title includes: `[Help needed] Your title`**

#### Why

I do this so others can look into the problem and the solution and also because I will be able to see what issues are mentioned the most so I can include examples in the new docs.

#### Important

To be very productive I switched off GH issues. As I said I'm experimenting here and I think this is going to make me productive.

##### Tldr;
- want to help with docs - send the PR with the new additions
- found a mistake - send the PR with the fix
- need help with your project - send the PR using the `playground` boilerplate
